Ghost Commander 1.51b5-supath

This is a unofficial mod of Ghost Commander 1.51b5; r395 of official svn.
(http://sites.google.com/site/ghostcommander1/)
This version added an option to specify your custom su location is added.

I created this fork because not all Android devices is capable of
putting su in $PATH without unwanted side effects; Some apps will
refuse to work, some other devices disable its important features
once it detects the existance of su.

The su location option is located at the advanced options; just
above the busybox location setting.

The apk of this version:
